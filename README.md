First of all, I want to mention that this was my first interaction with React, I am using Angular usually. 

Secondly, regarding task nr.2: "TEC theme is not displayed on the app bar instead a green color is seen.",
I did not understand this task, I thought there should be a theme in assets or somewhere in the files, a TEC
font or something but did not find anything so I implemented it my way, inspirated from TEC web page. :D

Added some extra features and a bit of styling.
